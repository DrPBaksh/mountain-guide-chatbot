# Mountain Guide Chatbot Images

This directory should contain the following images for the application:

- `mountain-header.jpg` - Header image for the main page (panoramic mountain landscape)
- `favicon.ico` - Favicon for the website (mountain icon)
- `logo192.png` - Logo for PWA and app icons (192x192)
- `logo512.png` - Larger logo for PWA and app icons (512x512)

You can use free-to-use mountain images from sources like Unsplash or Pexels, or create your own mountain-themed icons.

## Image Recommendations

1. For `mountain-header.jpg`: Use a panoramic mountain range image with good contrast for overlay text
2. For logos and favicon: A simple mountain peak silhouette on a colorful background works well
